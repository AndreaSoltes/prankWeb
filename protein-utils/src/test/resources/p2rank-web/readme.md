The original binding site for 2src as computed by p2rank was
```
71, 91, 93, 94, 95, 101, 117, 119,
189, 192, 197, 209, 211, 254, 255, 256, 257, 261, 302, 304, 306, 307, 309, 320,
440, 442, 444, 445
```
was replaced with
```
189, 192, 197, 209, 211, 254, 255, 256, 257, 261, 302, 304, 306, 307, 309, 320
```
as the original version also detected changed AA as a ligand, giving
false positive binding site.
